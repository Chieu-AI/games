# Create a simple mobile app using Unity (C#) or Flutter (Dart) that helps users quit smoking
# by cloning the core mechanics of Flappy Bird. The game should be engaging, simple to play,
# and integrate motivational quit-smoking features.

# Functional requirements:
# 1. Game screen where the player taps to keep an avatar (e.g., lungs, bird, or healthy symbol) in the air.
#    - Avoid obstacles themed around smoking (e.g., cigarettes, smoke clouds).
#    - When the avatar crashes, restart the game.
#
# 2. Home screen:
#    - Show the number of "Days Smoke-Free".
#    - Include a "Play" button to start the game.
#
# 3. Stats screen:
#    - Show "Days Smoke-Free".
#    - Show "Cravings Avoided" count.
#    - Button to "View Motivational Messages".
#
# 4. Messages screen:
#    - Display one motivational message at a time.
#    - Messages should rotate or be randomly selected from a predefined list.
#
# 5. Navigation:
#    - Use bottom tab navigation with "Home" and "Stats" as the main sections.
#
# 6. Persistent storage:
#    - Track streak (days smoke-free).
#    - Track cravings avoided (increase count every time user chooses to play during a craving).
#
# Optional:
# - Push notifications (e.g., "Play now instead of smoking!")
# - Sound effects and rewards for gameplay progress.

# Preferred framework: Unity (C#) or Flutter (Dart) with Flame engine
# Prioritize clean code, modular structure, and in-line comments explaining each function.

# Start by creating the base game screen and character controller logic.
